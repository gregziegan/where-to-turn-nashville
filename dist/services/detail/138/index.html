It is important to note that even when approved for a Section 8 voucher, the housing market in Nashville is extremely difficult to navigate and secure housing in; just because a complex accepts vouchers does not guarantee openings nor acceptance of an individual's application. **If you are working on receiving a Section 8 voucher, filing for expungements can significantly help you in your search for housing; for information on expungements visit, www.tncourts.gov/expungements. Section 8 vouchers are federally funded rental supplement programs. The waitlist for the general public is usually closed but check MDHA\u2019s website to confirm.
